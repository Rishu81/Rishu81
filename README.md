# Hi, I'm Rishabh Gupta! 👋

👨‍💻 I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Machine Learning/AI enthusiast** currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Thapar University. I love building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications.

## 🚀 My Skills & Interests:
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Hands-on experience with frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
- **Computer Vision & Natural Language Processing**: Projects involving face recognition, image processing, and speech-to-text models.
- **Software Development**: Strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system design, with proficiency in Python, C++.
- **API Development**: Built APIs for machine learning models using FastAPI.
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Experience with Google Cloud (Vertex AI), for continuous integration and deployment.

## 💼 Projects:
- **Frontal Face Generation using GANs**: Developed a system that generates frontal face views from side-view images using GANs, with potential applications in surveillance and security.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Contributed to a team project to build a predictive model using machine learning, and developed an API for the same using FastAPI.
- **Speech Command Recognition**: Fine-tuned an ASR model using the Speech Commands dataset to classify audio commands.
